# Fisheries Dependent Information Data Call

The Scientific Fisheries Dependent Information (FDI) database was
developed to support the management of fishing effort management
regimes. With a transition to area-based multi-annual plans there was an
opportunity to both rationalise the data base and move to the collection
of an EU wide data set of fishing capacity, effort, landings, and
discards. In 2018 the Commission requested the STECF to collect and
review data in relation to a newly specified Fisheries Dependent
Information Database. Expert working groups (STECF EWG-18-11, STECF
19-11, STECF 20-10) reviewed both the data supplied and the
appropriateness of the data call with respect to:

- Completeness of data in terms of areas of fishing, types of fleet
  segment and gear operated and species identified;
- Completeness of data in terms of type of data requested;
- The level of compatibility between the effort data in the FDI database
  and that submitted to the Mediterranean and Black Sea data call;
- The level of compatibility between the landings data in the FDI
  database and that submitted to the Mediterranean and Black Sea data
  call for those species listed.
